ANOVA- independent categorical variable + concomitent variable (not to forget to avoid unmask the importance of this) = continous variable.
concomitent variable is additional independent variable that is continous/numeric variable in ANOVA

PCA is used in predictive algorithem. helps in unsupervised learning.
scree plot is also called elbow graph. you shall stop taking eigen vectors with eigen values beyond the elbow point in the scree plot.


take the eigen vector and multiply it with actual values based on the factor in the eigen vector
i.e multiple the respective columns with the equivalent eigen vetor in the PC1 for the explicit form.write this equation.
if the eigen vector for a column is negative take only abs value or mention the sign but make a note that it is just a direction
Please note that a given PCA (1st component in this case) is a representation of how one single dimension varies with
	every other dimension. and hence the number in eigen vector for a given PCA is the factor by which given dimension varies with respective every other column


for scaling:
if the data is skewed , first that needs to be scaled and then followed by standardized using standardscaler.
only if the data is normally distributed then use standardscalar else use minmaxscaler to standardize it.
standardscaler should be after imputing outlier as outlires impact standard scaler
