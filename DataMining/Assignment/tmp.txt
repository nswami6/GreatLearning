All the models have performed almost equally with short difference between each other from accuracy stand point.
Hence CART model has performed better in this case providing highest accuracy level. 

Given the fact predicting both classes of customer's who will end up claiming and those who will not claim are important 
towards being able to come up with appropriate recommendation, accuracy becomes an important factor here. This way
the model that best controls both type 1 and type 2 error would enable efficient overall classification from prediction 
perspective. Accordingly CART model fairs better comparatively here with 78% accuracy on the test data.

Also the fact that F1 score of claims(63%) being the highest compared to other models there is a fair chance of better 
prediction of actual claims that will impact the profit and loss of the overall performance of the insurance plans.
