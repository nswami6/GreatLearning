Imputing the data should not change the central tendency too much i.e mean, median... in such a case where there is
	an impact to the central tendency one can look at deciding on removing the outliers rather than imputing.

Sometimes we might have to choose ML algorithms which might not be impacted by outliers and check the outcome before we 
	choose to proceed with outlier imputation for other algorithms that needs that step.
